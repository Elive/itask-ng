Itask NG Module 

This is the NG module for Enlightenment.

It will hold all of your open applications for fast switching and
is also an apllication launcher.


There are three basic functionalities that you dont want to miss:
1. If you click on an icon the corresponding  will be shown and
   raised to the top and if its on another desk, then you will 
   be switched right to it. 
2. If you drag an icon out of NG the App will be shown on the
   current desktop.
3. Drag an icon to a pagers desk to send it there.


lots of other stuff that you have to find out yourself for now :)

Installation:
./autogen.sh
make 
make install

when having troubles: check the wiki on:

This module is based on ibox and on engages algorithms. though thats
where it started. you'll not find much common code anymore


_______ATTENTION______________________________________________

you SHOULD have composite manager running like for example 
bling (from e_modules) xcompmgr or kompmgr(kdebase).

run enlightenment_remote -use-composite-set 1
and then restart e to enable the use of composite

you dont need it, just looks way cooler B-) otherwise you should

uggly pixel shaped borders
